**Mdat plugin to generate tabular help documentation for CLI tools in Markdown files.**

<!-- /short-description -->

## Overview

_**This is a plugin for the [mdat CLI tool](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/mdat), which is a simple Markdown templating system optimized for embedding dynamic content in repository readmes and the like.**_

This plugin automatically transforms a CLI command's `--help` output into nicely formatted Markdown tables.

The rule also recursively calls `--help` on any subcommands found for inclusion in the output.

Currently, the rule can parse help output in the format provided by [Commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js)-, [Yargs](https://yargs.js.org)-, and [Meow](https://github.com/sindresorhus/meow)-based tools. If parsing fails, the rule will fall back to show the raw help output in a regular code block instead.

## Getting started

### Dependencies

We'll assume you have [mdat](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/mdat) installed either globally or in your local project.

### Installation

Install the plugin as a development dependency:

```bash
pnpm add -D mdat-plugin-cli-help
```

Register the plugin in your mdat config file, e.g. `mdat.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'mdat'
import cliHelp from 'mdat-plugin-cli-help'

export default defineConfig({
  ...cliHelp,
})
```

## Usage

Assuming you have an executable with a `--help` flag on your path or in your project's scope:

```markdown
<!-- cli-help({ cliCommand: "mdat", depth: 1 }) -->
```

Then run the `mdat` CLI command on your Markdown file to expand the rule and embed the tabular help output:

````markdown
<!-- cli-help({ cliCommand: "mdat", depth: 1 }) -->

#### Command: `mdat`

Work with MDAT placeholder comments in any Markdown file.

If no command is provided, `mdat expand` is run by default.

Usage:

```txt
mdat [command]
```

<!-- /cli-help -->
````

The command is also aliased under the `<!-- cli -->` keyword.

This would have equivalent output to the above:

```markdown
<!-- cli({ cliCommand: "mdat", depth: 1 }) -->
```

If you embed the rule without any arguments, it will look for the binary file listed in the closest `package.json` file and run it with `--help`. This is what you want if you're documenting a package's CLI options in its readme.md file:

```markdown
<!-- cli-help -->
```

### Supported CLI frameworks

#### [Yargs](https://yargs.js.org)

Fully supported, including options, commands, positionals, choices, defaults, and type annotations.

The parser handles line-wrapped output by unwrapping continuation lines before parsing. However, when Yargs wraps command _arguments_ onto new lines at very narrow terminal widths (e.g. below \~70 columns), those wrapped argument lines are indistinguishable from new command rows and cannot be reliably unwrapped. In practice, this is rare.

For the most reliable parsing if you control the upstream project, configure your Yargs CLI to disable wrapping:

```ts
yargs(process.argv).wrap(process.stdout.isTTY ? Math.min(120, yargs.terminalWidth()) : 0)
```

This outputs unwrapped help text when piped, while preserving normal wrapping for interactive use.

#### [Commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js)

Fully supported, including options, commands, arguments (positionals), and parenthesized defaults with optional environment variable annotations (e.g. `(default: "value", env: MY_VAR)`).

The parser handles line-wrapped output by unwrapping continuation lines before parsing. Commander's built-in `help` command is automatically filtered from subcommand recursion to avoid duplicate output.

#### [Meow](https://github.com/sindresorhus/meow)

Should be fully supported or nearly so.

## Development notes

Parsing arbitrary `--help` output is a bit tricky.

You're right to think that an LLM could make quick work of this kind of "fuzzy text to structured data" transcription. However, when this tool was originally developed in 2024, testing a language model approach yielded sub-par results, so I pursued a traditional lexer/parser approach instead. There is also the logistical overhead of providing a smart-enough model both locally and in CI, where this tool frequently runs; it's technically feasible, but unpleasant. While the current hand-tuned parsers are admittedly a brittle tangle, future versions may revisit the LLM approach.

In terms of prior art, the [jc](https://github.com/kellyjonbrazil/jc) project stands out as a heroic collection of CLI-tool output parsers, but does not currently implement help output parsing. It might be interesting to try to contribute mdat's help parsing implementations to jc.

Currently, the parser implementation lives in this repository because I really only use it in the context of my CLI tool readme files. In theory, it really belongs in a separate package.
